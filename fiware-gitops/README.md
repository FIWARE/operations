### What is FIWARE GitOps?

GitOps is an automated approach to system and infrastructure administration. The source code for such system is stored in Git and
attached to a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system to manage FIWARE enterprise systems quickly and accurately.
This repository provides standard patterns to be used within GitOps

### Why use FIWARE GitOps?

As production-level FIWARE Systems grow in size, their maintainence requirements also increase. Without help this soon rises beyond the 
capability of a purely manual maintance team. FIWARE GitOps allows you to leverage the modern automated deployment paradigms required
to maintain FIWARE  enterprise architectures at scale. The best way to ensure the reliability of an enterprise architecture is to automate it.
