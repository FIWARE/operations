### What is FIWARE Helm Charts?

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a mechanism to help manage your Kubernetes applications. Individual Helm Charts help you define, install, 
and consistently upgrade applications. This repository provides standard Helm Charts of Generic Enablers from the FIWARE Catalogue.
The charts can be install into Kubernetes using helm3.


### Why use FIWARE Helm Charts?

Helm simplifies the deployment process allowing you to take a basic  common template, and then override the value you need. This repository 
holds those standardized template files using common default values, so you can create your deployments using minimal infrastructure as code.
